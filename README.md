# Recipe-App-SwiftUI
A recipe app built using SwiftUI. All the recipes and info is being parsed from a local JSON file. The algorithm to calculate the amount of ingredients based on the number of servings is fully functioning, and can be customised further without having to modify the algorithm in any way.
